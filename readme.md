# SpreadJS-play

This Project has no SpreadJS license, it is only for demo purposes.

## Requirements

These samples need to be opened via `http://localhost/...` because of the SpreadJS demo license.

## Simple webserver startup

Samples work on port 8000, maybe you have to choose another one.

### python

    python3 -m http.server 8000

### php

    php -S localhost:8000
                                                                
### go

    go run mjpclab.dev/ghfs@latest -l ":8000"

## Usage

Default the sample size is 1k and should load on every system very fast. To stress up a little bit the system, choose from the select box on top one other sample.

The `remote 100k` will be loaded from the `github.io` page directly.
